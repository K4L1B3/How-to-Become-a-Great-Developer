# How-to-Become-a-Great-Developer

## About this project
> I have several acquaintances and friends of mine who say they want to get a job in the programming area, but they don't really know where to start or where to look and etc... my goal with this project here is to create a guide for myself and those other people who want to become great programmers is basically a REFERENCE GUIDE in which there are several tips on how to program, the best way to get a job, links and programming courses. I focused more on two languages that I use the most on a daily basis, which are Java and Javascript.

* ### The F I R S T step
Okay, now let's start the trail so you know where to start. It is very important that you choose a single programming language first and only after you master it and know a framework do we start to venture into other programming languages.

 * Research first which area you want to follow, if you prefer something more logical as a back-end then I recommend you start with Java or if you prefer something more visual as a front-end my recommendation is Javascript, in the end this is just the order of learning, because in the job market you will need to know a little about each thing so you will end up learning both the back-end and front-end areas
 * Study about programming logic
 * Before starting programming I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdsnXVqbHDUc7htGFobbZoNen3r_wm3ki">this playlist<a/> by Fabio Akita

***This site can help you choose and understand what you will need to learn when studying this language:*** https://roadmap.sh/

* ### Step 1.2: Learn English
You have to know english and this is not negotiable if you want to have a place in the job market or earn a good salary

  * In case you don't have the money to pay for an English course I'll show you how I study English in my daily life in 2022
    1. ***LEAVE EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING IN ENGLISH*** (series, movies, anime, comics, books your operating system, browser and etc... consume everything you can in English the goal is to make a simulation)
    2. Make a word table with categories of everyday situations
    3. Use flashcards with the word table to improve fixation
    4. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro: </a> study 90 min/rest 20 min) + Spaced Study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">(Forgetting Curve)</a>
    5. Doing Exercises in the Duolingo App
    6. Practice English with someone 

* ### Step 2: how to learn programming?
You will have to be self-taught and look for yourself the best way to learn a programming language is based on 4 simple steps, and they are:

- Read language documentation
- Practice a lot every day
- Gain experience in the errors of your code
- Keep consistency

But to say that I'm not here just stating the obvious I'm going to give you a study routine that you can follow in addition to sites to practice solving problems daily

#### Pomodoro session 1: study 90 min/rest 20 min 
  * Solve 2 exercise with the main language (in my case it's Java)
  * Practicing 1 programming marathon exercise per day (This helps a lot to have good programming logic.)

#### Pomodoro session 2: study 90 min/rest 20 min
  - Work on small projects with languages you haven't fully mastered yet (in my case it's Javascript and ReactJS)

#### Pomodoro session 3: study 90 min/rest 20 min
  - Watch class of bootcamps every day (Here you learn new things for free and even add it to your curriculum)

### Step 3: Join communities
Why should I join a community?
- There you can meet people
- Clear your programming doubts
- Learning by helping others

The only active community that helps to solve programming problems I've encountered so far is the <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">rocket seat group<a/>

* ### Step 4: how to get a job???
 
 Well, from everything I've tested, I believe that the best way to get a job whether you have college or not is to work on the following points:
 * Work on the portfolio by doing small projects
 * Go to technology, hackathons and entrepreneurship events and make network with professionals in the area (and who knows, leave with a business idea to start a company heheh)
 * Study a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework<a/> that appears most in linkedin vacancies, in the market today we have: 
      
      * <a href="https://angular.io/docs">Ã‚ngular<a/>
