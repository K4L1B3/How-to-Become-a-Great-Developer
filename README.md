# How-to-Become-a-Great-Developer

## About this project
> I have several acquaintances and friends of mine who say they want to get a job in the programming field, but don't really know where to start or where to look and etc... my goal with this project here is to create a guide for both myself and those other people who want to become great programmers

* ### The first step
Okay, now let's start the trail so you know where to start. It is very important that you choose a single programming language first and only after you master it and know a framework do we start to venture into other programming languages.

 * Research first which area you want to follow, if you prefer something more logical as a back-end then I recommend you start with Java or if you prefer something more visual as a front-end my recommendation is Javascript, in the end this is just the order of learning, because in the job market you will need to know a little about each thing so you will end up learning both the back-end and front-end areas
 * Study about programming logic
 

* ### Step 1.2: Learn English
You have to know english and this is not negotiable if you want to have a place in the job market or earn a good salary

  * In case you don't have the money to pay for an English course I'll show you how I study English in my daily life in 2022
    1. ***LEAVE EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING IN ENGLISH*** (series, movies, anime, comics, books your operating system, browser and etc... consume everything you can in English the goal is to make a simulation)
    2. Make a word table with categories of everyday situations
    3. Use flashcards with the word table to improve fixation
    4. (Pomodoro 90 min) + Spaced Study (Forgetting Curve)
    5. Doing Exercises in the Duolingo App
    6. Practice English with someone 

* ### Step 2: how to learn programming?
You will have to be self-taught and look for yourself the best way to learn a programming language is based on 4 simple steps, and they are:

- Read language documentation
- Practice a lot every day
- Gain experience in the errors of your code
- Keep consistency

But to say that I'm not here just stating the obvious I'm going to give you a study routine that you can follow in addition to sites to practice solving problems daily

<h1>Ainda irei organizar por enquanto vou deixar esse rascunho aqui mesmo<h1>

- Trabalha o portfólio fazendo mini projetos
- Vai em eventos de tecnologia e empreendedorismo fazer networking (e quem sabe  sai de lá com uma ideia de negócios para montar uma emrpesa)
- Escolher uma área de programação para começar e se espacializar nele, depois estudar um pouco de cada coisa você pode acessar o site roadmap.sh que vai te dar um direcionamento melhor sobre oque estudar em cada área
- Estudar um framework que mais aparece nas vagas do linkedin (recomendo procurar por ângular e springboot)
- Participar dos bootcamps da DIO
- Fazer exercicios das maratonas de programação (e quem sabe participar de uma)
